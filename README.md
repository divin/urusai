# うるさい (Urusai) - Jekyll Theme

Written by myself, using Jekyll, HTML, CSS (SASS) and Javascript. You might be able to use it but you probably need to adjust a lot of things, I host it here so I can use it as remote theme for my project pages. You can also use it as remote theme by adding the following to your `_config.yaml`:

```
plugins:
  - jekyll-remote-theme
 
remote_theme: divin/Urusai
```
